# Fastify-Web-API

![cover](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SEaHrou3ctfEvfPzUnoHag.png)

Fastify is a popular Node.js web framework that is known for its speed and low overhead. Swagger is an open-source framework for designing, building, and documenting APIs. Together, they can be used to create an API Set that is both efficient and well-documented.

This project is a basic Fastify + Swagger application: 5 routes and methods for users CRUD: readAll, readOne, Create, Update, Delete

For more information, for Heroku integrations, please take a look at my post: https://medium.com/@simonescigliuzzi/x-c6eb1c293215
